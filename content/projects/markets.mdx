This website is intended to be used by people/business owner's who would like to be a vendor at a farmer's market, but do not know which farmer's market they should attend. This website acts as a browser for farmer's markets and also gives an interface to apply to be a vendor at a given farmer's market.

Main selling point of the website is that is allows the user to create a profile where they can enter their business details and personal information. This speeds up the processes of applying to a be a vendor as that business/personal information is used when applying, therefore, the user only has to enter the information once.
