My task was to create a website to represent and make the database more usable.
Also, I assisted in the backend to configure the database.

This repositry includes all the files which I created for the functioning of the front-end of the website through which we can access the mysql database.

Sql database source : relational.fit.cvut.cz

Database name : Classic models
